# portfolio-carbon
This is my static site and portfolio. Built with Eleventy.

I use this space to experiment with web performance, accessibility, semantic HTML and modern CSS. It's not perfect, and some parts are rough, but I'm always tinkering. And there's thought behind everything, and joy. Joy in making, instead of prompting.
