My personal portfolio. Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

In additional to showcasing my work, I use this space to experiment web performance, accessibility, semantic HTML and modern CSS. It's not perfect, and some parts are rough (like really rough), but I'm always learning. And there's thought behind everything, and joy. Joy in making, instead of prompting.

Here's the [live version](https://anciutin.com/) of the site.
