title: 'Increased early adoption by delivering a browser-based CNC programming experience for Sandvik'
company: 'Sandvik is a global engineering group founded in Sweden, known for its advanced tools and solutions in the mining, construction, and manufacturing industries.'
problem: 'In 2021, Sandvik developed an iPad-focused CNC machine programming solution that gained early traction, but struggled to grow as many customers were desktop-only. I worked alongside a small team to transition the experience to the browser, making it device-agnostic and accessible to a broader customer base.'
capabilities: [2, 4, 5]
industry: 'Manufacturing'
year: '2021'
