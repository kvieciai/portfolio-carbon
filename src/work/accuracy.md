title: 'Improved accuracy of risk assessments by delivering consolidated financial insights for Tink customers'
company: 'Tink is a Stockholm based fintech platform offering open banking APIs and financial data services to banks and developers worldwide.'
problem: 'In 2022, Tink discovered that the overall risk experience was fragmented: customers using risk offerings had to shuffle between multiple APIs, reports, and views to get the financial insights they needed. I worked alongside product managers, engineers, and customers to build a centralized risk experience that provided a single place to assess the affordability of an applicant.'

note: "From day one, we brought our key customers (AMEX and Nordea) directly into our process. This proximity gave us a view into their workflows and allowed to build functionality that genuinely solved their problems. It sounds obvious, yet staying close to customers is surprisingly easy to forget."
